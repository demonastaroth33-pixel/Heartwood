# Mobbin Prompts

Generate prompt-ready context from captured artifacts.

Use:

```bash
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs <action> '<json>'
```

## Selectors

All actions can select artifacts with `artifact_ids`, `query`, `tags`, `type`, `app_name`, `feature_area`, `limit`, and `project_path`.

Prefer selecting by `feature_area`, `tags`, or explicit `artifact_ids` when a prompt should stay tied to a specific captured flow. Direct Mobbin capture actions store flow steps, patterns, elements, source URLs, and visual hashes, so prompt output is strongest after `capture-flow`, `capture-screen`, or `capture-site-sections` has been used.

## Actions

- `feature-prompt`: unified MCP-equivalent prompt generator; `mode` is `implementation`, `analysis`, or `onboarding`
- `implementation-prompt`: implementation brief from references; requires or benefits from `objective`
- `analysis-prompt`: intended-vs-current analysis brief
- `onboarding-prompt`: teammate onboarding brief
- `agent-context`: target-specific context; `target` is `codex`, `claude_code`, `pi`, or `mem_palace`
- `pr-reference`: PR-ready markdown; accepts `title` and `objective`
- `feature-review`: diff-style review using `intended_artifact_ids` or `intended_query`, plus `actual_artifact_ids` or `actual_query`

## Examples

```bash
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs feature-prompt '{"mode":"implementation","objective":"Build checkout confirmation","feature_area":"checkout","limit":6}'
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs implementation-prompt '{"objective":"Build checkout confirmation","feature_area":"checkout","limit":6}'
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs analysis-prompt '{"objective":"Compare shipped checkout against saved Mobbin references","feature_area":"checkout","type":"flow","limit":4}'
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs agent-context '{"target":"mem_palace","query":"onboarding","limit":10}'
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs pr-reference '{"title":"Checkout reference pack","objective":"Implement the confirmation step","tags":["checkout"]}'
node scripts/mobbin-prompts.mjs feature-review '{"title":"Checkout review","intended_query":"checkout references","actual_query":"checkout shipped"}'
```
